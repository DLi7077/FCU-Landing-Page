      'Tis the season to be jolly! And unfortunately, 'tis also the season for
      scammers to go after your hard-earned dollars. Keep your money safe by
      reading up on the most common scams taking place this time of year and
      practicing caution.
      <br />
      <div>
        <strong>1. Phishing emails </strong>
        <br />
        Always popular, phishing scams get even more prevalent before the
        holidays.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        They can take the form of bogus delivery confirmation requests seeking
        your information or even a personalized letter to your child from
        “Santa.” Be extra careful this holiday season when it comes to sharing
        personal information online or with an unverified requester.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>2. Fake charities </strong>
        <br />
        Sadly, many scammers will capitalize on the goodwill that flourishes
        this time of year by asking you to make a donation to a charity that
        does not actually exist. Verify the authenticity of any charity you'd
        like to make a contribution to by checking it out on a website like
        CharityNavigator.org. Also, it's best to contact a charity on your own
        instead of following a website or email link.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>3. Package theft </strong>
        <br />
        It's holiday time, and those UPS and FedEx trucks are everywhere,
        dropping off boxes of goodies all over the neighborhood. Usually, these
        drop-offs go as planned.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        Unfortunately, though, some 23 million customers will have their
        packages stolen from their doorsteps this year. Don't be one of them! If
        possible, and especially when ordering something expensive, arrange for
        a delivery that requires your signature upon receipt. Otherwise, track
        your order and know when to look out for it so you can bring it inside
        as quickly as possible after it's dropped off.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        When sending a gift to someone else via Amazon, consider sending it to
        an Amazon Locker location instead of to the recipient's household.
        There's no fee for using this service, and this way, your gift is safe.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>4. Bogus sites </strong>
        <br />
        You might get lucky and find that perfect gift at a super-low price, but
        don't believe any ads or websites that are practically giving away the
        good stuff for free.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        These are, quite likely, scams. Once you click an ad link and place an
        order, you'll never hear from the site again. Worse yet, they may use
        the information you shared to empty your accounts. Only shop on
        reputable sites. Remember to check the website address/URL before
        placing an order.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        It may look strikingly similar to a popular site, but if one letter is
        off or missing completely, the site is bogus and you need to get out.
        Also, always look for that important “s” after the “http” in the web
        address to verify a site's security.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>5. Fake freebies </strong>
        <br />
        Did you really just see a Facebook post offering you a new iPhone,
        completely free of charge?
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        If you have, run the other way and don't look back! You're looking at a
        scam, designed to lure you into sharing your information with criminals
        or unwittingly installing malware on your device.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        Fake freebies run the gamut from new phones, complementary cruises and
        various luxury gift items to free holiday-themed downloads, like music,
        wallpaper and games. If you're offered any outrageous free gifts by text
        message, email or social media posts, ignore them.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        Downloads, though, may be safe, but need to be carefully vetted for
        authenticity before you accept them.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>6. Defunct gift cards </strong>
        <br />
        Many scammers sell expired or empty gift cards this time of year, hoping
        to make a profit on a card that isn't worth more than the plastic used
        to make it. Ask to inspect any gift card you purchase before you
        finalize the sale. Check to see if the activation code is exposed. If it
        is, the scammer has probably already used the card or has copied the
        information and will use it soon.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>7. Temporary holiday jobs </strong>
        <br />
        Lots of businesses are hiring extra hands to get them through the busy
        holiday season. Don't get stuck working for criminals!
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        Many scammers will pose as employees of recognized businesses and post
        help-wanted ads on social media platforms and popular websites. When a
        job seeker follows the links in these ads, they are directed to a bogus
        site that looks just like the site of the company the scammer claims to
        represent. They'll be asked to share personal information to submit an
        application. The scammer will then make off with this information and
        the promised job will never materialize.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        If you're looking for a seasonal job, apply in-person or directly on a
        business's website. Do not follow any links.
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        As always, be aware and be cautious when enjoying the holiday season.
        <br />
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        Don't get grinched! Stay alert and use caution to keep your money - and
        your information - safe.
