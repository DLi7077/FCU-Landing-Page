        New York University Federal Credit Union Selects Digital Onboarding Inc.
        to Provide an Enhanced Member Experience.{" "}

      <div>
        New York, N.Y. (January 22, 2020) - New York University Federal Credit
        Union currently has over 5,000 members and about $20 million in assets.
        NYU FCU needed help automating and updating the process for onboarding
        new members after accounts are opened. After extensive research, NYU FCU
        chose to partner with Digital Onboarding because of its creative,
        intuitive and customizable platform.

        Javelin Strategy and Research reported that 25% of consumers believe
        that tasks such as enrolling in online banking are complicated, which
        negatively affects customer engagement and new account activation rates.
        Since a fully engaged customer drives $5,724 more in annual revenue
        compared to an inactive customer, the impact of an effective and
        efficient new account onboarding experience can be significant.

        “For quite some time our digital experience was very disconnected, our
        partnership with Digital Onboarding allows us to offer a seamless
        digital experience to all of our members. In New York, our members are
        always on the go so it is important that we can easily connect any time,
        anywhere” said Mira Ness, CEO. “Before Digital Onboarding, NYU FCU was
        manually processing every membership application. There was tremendous
        loss in potential members who started the process, but never completed-
        due to non-automated steps in the membership journey.”
        <div style={{ height: ".5rem" }} />
        With NYU FCU partnering with Digital Onboarding, it allows the credit
        union to streamline the membership application journey, grow engagement,
        and build deeper relationships with its members. The NYU FCU team had an
        expedited timeline in wanting to implement Digital Onboarding quickly
        due to the disconnected digital experience that its front line staff and
        members were dealing with. From kick-off to going live, the NYU FCU and
        Digital Onboarding teams were able to create customized content and are
        able to start implementing the platform within one month.

        “A credit union can differentiate itself from others by delivering a
        superior overall experience to its members,” said Ted Brown, Chief
        Executive Officer at Digital Onboarding. “With the Digital Onboarding
        platform, NYU FCU is ensuring members have an exceptional interaction
        with the credit union to form long-lasting relationships.”
