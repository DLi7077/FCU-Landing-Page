      Dining out with family and friends is a wonderful experience, but it can
      take a huge bite out of your budget. No worries—we're not going to try
      convincing you to give up your favorite fast food restaurant. Instead, use
      our hacks to trim your bill when dining out.
      <div>
        <strong>1. Look left </strong>
        <br />
        When looking at a menu, most people's eyes drift to the right.
        Restaurants know this and purposely put their most expensive items on
        the right side of the menu. Check out the left side of the menu for
        cheaper options, or appetizers that can make a full meal, before looking
        right.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>2. Eat out on Mondays and Tuesdays </strong>
        <br />
        The beginning of the week is slow for the restaurant industry. Take
        advantage of specials and discounts that eateries offer only on Mondays
        and Tuesdays.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>Skip the Chef's "Special" </strong>
        <br />
        The Chef Special you're looking at on the menu is actually not that
        special at all. It's more like a code for "We just inflated the price on
        this dish for no reason."
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>4. Don't eat out on major holidays </strong>
        <br />
        To make major holidays super-profitable, many eateries only offer
        fixed-price menus on these days. These menus might sound cheap until you
        consider that the four-course meal going for $55 is a lot more expensive
        than the $18 entrée you'd have otherwise ordered. If you'd really like
        to celebrate these special days with a restaurant meal, consider eating
        out the day before or the day after the holiday.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>5. Take it to go </strong>
        <br />
        Pick up food from your favorite eatery and enjoy it at home. You'll save
        on server tips, beverage costs and extras, too.
        <br />
        To make it super-cheap, only purchase the entrée. Then, roast some
        veggies and potatoes at home for a quick side and crack open a tub of
        rocky road ice cream for dessert.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>6. Drink water </strong>
        <br />
        Restaurants are notorious for marking up beverage prices. Soft drinks
        can be marked up by 400% and alcoholic beverages by 600%. Ask for water
        and you'll save a pretty penny on your final check.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>7. Don't pay full price </strong>
        <br />
        Never walk into a restaurant without first checking for online deals and
        coupons. Visit the eatery's website and also check out restaurant deal
        sites like Groupon, LivingSocial, Restaurant.com and OpenTable.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>8. Split it</strong>
        <br />
        Instead of ordering individual portions that look like they were created
        for giants, split an entrée with your dining partner.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>9. Eat like a kid</strong>
        <br />
        If the restaurant allows, order from the kids' menu. The items there are
        always priced better and you might find that one or two kids' menu
        choices is enough to keep you satisfied.
      </div>
      <div>
        <strong>10. Skip dessert</strong>
        <br />
        It takes our stomachs a while to get the memo that we've had enough.
        Don't order dessert right after scraping your plate clean. Wait and you
        might find that you're so full, you can't eat another morsel.
